Stochastic Maximum Likelihood with Adaptive Parallel Tempering

This code accompanies the following paper:

Adaptive Parallel Tempering for Stochastic Maximum Likelihood Learning of RBMs
Guillaume Desjardins, Aaron Courville and Yoshua Bengio
NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning.

The code is old and deprecated, in that I am no longer pursuing this particular
research topic. I am thus submitting it as is, in the hope it might be useful to
someone else. Do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions on
the material.

WARNING: Comments are sparse and (worse) possibly out of date.
